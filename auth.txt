Make "remember me" optional?

endpoints:
GET /auth (check logged in status)
POST /auth/identity (log in)

GET /account (get profile)
PATCH /account (change profile)
DELETE /account (delete account)

GET /account/logins
POST /account/logins/identity (create new account or link login to account)
DELETE /account/logins/identity (unlink login)

create account first and patch profile later

In login guard:
* Check if user has valid JWT token (GET /auth):
** Yes: auto-login the user
** No:
*** Put intended URL in store
*** Follow flow chart (give consent before account creation)

When API request fails because of expired JWT token
* "You have been logged out due to inactivity"
* Put current URL in store
* Present login screen (offer link to registration, offer link to both on home page)
* Get JWT token by POSTing to /auth/password or /auth/google

How to link specific Google/Facebook/Twitter accounts?
How to handle refresh? -> Use refresh token with sequence number! DON'T log it!
How to invalidate existing tokens after password change? -> Refresh token sequence number
How to handle logout -> remove cookies & use tab events

Store in user profile:
* Email address
* Password hash
* Refresh token sequence number (increase on password change)
* Admin flag
* Default display name
* Language
* Timezone

What about profiles for "scripts"?

Store in JWT:
* User ID
* Expiration date

Joken vs Guardian in backend? or use POW?

Accept JWTs in Cookies for "user" and "admin" roles and in Authorization headers only for a special "script" role (require access key for each "script" request?)
Make "scripts" call backend directly instead of using API?
